##  **Question 7: What is Alex Morgan’s educational background according to ConnectPro?**

On ConnectPro, the Education tab shows the name of the university Alex attended. The platform highlights **the institution**, not the major. For none natives, this is important because ConnectPro tends to focus on the school name as the primary identifier of educational background. Therefore, the correct OSINT answer is simply **the university listed on his profile**, not the field of study.
